1. Webserver configured on EC2 instance
   
   First install httpd : 
   yum install httpd

   start httpd service :
   systemctl start httpd

2. Now, the volume that we attached in previous article we have to mount that volume to the document root (/var/www/html) to make it permanent.

   First Create partition 
   Formate the Partition
   Mount this partition to root document

3. Static objects used in code such as pictures stored in S3
   First Create a s3 bucket:
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket aws-2-task --region ap-south-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-south-1
  
   Then, Insert a image in the bucket.

   Now make the bucket and image Public
   •for bucket
   aws s3api put- bucket -ac1 --ac1- public read --bucket aws-2-task
   •for object
   aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket aws-2-task --key download.jpg --grant-read url=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers

   Now, we can see the object from Browser but Image displayed with low speed and high latency.
   So, for high speed and low latency, use the concept of Cloudfront.

4. Setting up Content Delivery Network using CloudFront and using the origin domain as S3 bucket.
   Now, Create Cloud front distribution
   aws cloudfront create-distribution --origin-domain-name aws-2-task.s3.amazonaws.com --default-root-object download.jpg

5. Finally, place the Cloud Front URL on the web app code for security and low latency.
   See the webserver
